// program-counter capture makes the pair name an offset, a constant
// displacement added to it makes the pair name another, a call writes the
// offset it returns to, and any other write drops what the pair named.
//
// When a block does not write the pair its transfer reads, the transfer reads
// what the paths into the block left there. A forward dataflow over the
// recovered blocks collects those offsets. If any path leaves the pair holding
// something the analysis cannot name, it refuses the transfer instead of
// narrowing it to the paths that did name an offset.
//
// `BlockStarts` is the block-start set of the same decode. It is read, not
// written: the offsets contributed by the transfers are reported separately so
// that the caller can order the merge against the rest of its decode.
// `EntryOffset` is where control enters, which need not be the lowest offset in
// `Insts`: a callee followed into the decode may sit below its caller.
